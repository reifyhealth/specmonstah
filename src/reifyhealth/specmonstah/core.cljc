;; relations
;; -----------------

;; About relations:
;; In these comments I'll use capital letters like A and B to refer to
;; types.

;; A relation is the description of how ents of type A reference ents
;; of type B. For example, in this:
;;
;; {:user {}
;;  :todo {:relations {:created-by-id [:user :id]}}}
;;
;; a Todo's `:created-by-id` key references a User, such that
;; :created-by-id should equal the User's `:id`
;;
;; /end About relations


;; In the following schema:
;;
;; {:user {}
;;  :todo {:relations {:created-by-id [:user :id]}}}
;;
;; the relation-path is `[:user :id]`
